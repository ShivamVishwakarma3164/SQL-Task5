# SQL-Task5

Objective:
The goal of this task is to learn how to combine data from two related tables using different types of SQL joins. I created two tables and used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN (using UNION in MySQL).

What I did:
Created two related tables: Students and Enrollments

Inserted sample data into both tables

Used different types of joins to understand how data is combined from multiple tables

Used UNION as a workaround for FULL JOIN in MySQL

Tables Created:
Students: stores student details

Enrollments: stores which course a student is enrolled in

The Enrollments table has a foreign key that references the Students table.


Result:
From this task, I learned how to merge data from two tables using different types of joins.
Now I understand the differences between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins, and how to use them to extract useful combined information.
